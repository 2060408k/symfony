title: Symfony 3 Fundamentals: Bundles, Configuration & Environments

summary: |
    After [episode 1](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/symfony), you've
    got Symfony up and running. CELEBRATION!

    In this episode, it's time to get down to work by learning the
    fundamental concepts of bundles, configuration and environments!
    We'll discover what all the files in a Symfony project do and why,
    the purpose of bundles and the power behind *environments*. So
    let's get to work: what we're about to learn will pay dividends
    for us in the future:

    - Where do services come from?
    - Installing an external bundle
    - Configuring bundles
    - Controller outside services
    - Using `config:dump-reference`
    - Understanding Symfony environments
    - Create your own environment
    - The `prod` environment and `cache:clear`
    - The famous `parameters.yml`
    - Where do routes come from?
    - `src/` versus `app`


    Ready, set, go!
