# Start Project

Welcome! I'm really excited that you are learning Symfony, it's the hardest framework you'll
ever use! Just kidding! Symfony has a reputation for being really hard, and part of what I want
to show you is how that is not the case. Symfony can be incredibly simple. But, when it does get
a bit more difficult it's because you're learning best practices and object oriented stuff. In this
series we'll ease you into those topics. Our first goal is to get you productive with Symfony as quickly
as possible. 

What is Symfony anyways? It's just a set of components, which just means 30 small PHP libraries. That means
that you could use Symfony in your project today by using one of its little libraries. One of my favorites
is called Finder, it's really good at locating files within a directory structure. 

Symfony is also a framework which means we've taken all of those components and glued them together for
you so that you can get things done faster. This series is all about doing *amazing* things with the
Symfony framework. 

In the background one of the things you'll notice is that Symfony is all about standards and best practices.
As you're building your dream project you're also becoming a better developer in the process. 

Let's get our first Symfony project going. Head over to Symfony.com, click 'download'. Our first task here
is to get the `Symfony Installer`.
