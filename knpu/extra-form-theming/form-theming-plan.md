Form Theming!

- show form(form), form_widget, then revert to form_row
- show form_widget, label, errors
- override the variable and add an attr
    -> debugging (dump) / viewing these in profiler

- create a basic form theme: override form_row(?) to add
    something addition if there is an error
    - block naming convention
- using variables (and debugging them) in the form theme

- adding a help piece, by passing in that variable
- finishView
- custom form type extension?

- Change firstDiscoveredAt (temporarily) into the choice
    type to show how we really do have 3 different sub-fields

- use variables in your main, normal template: perhaps
    we go rogue and render the firstDiscoveredAt field ourself.
- marking a field as custom rendered
