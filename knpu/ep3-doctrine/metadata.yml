title: Getting started with Symfony 3: Doctrine & the Database

summary: |
    After [episode 1](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/symfony), you
    are already up and running with Symfony. Check you out!

    Now it's time to make things more interesting by talking to the
    database with Doctrine.

    Doctrine has a reputation for being tough to learn, and that's
    unfortunate, because it's an amazing tool. In this tutorial, we'll
    get you rolling with Doctrine: learn how to use it, how to get
    hard work done easily and how to avoid the common pitfalls that
    *can* make Doctrine hard:

    * Creating entity classes
    * Managing migrations
    * Saving new data
    * Querying for data
    * Custom repositories
    * Custom queries and the query builder
    * Mapping options (and how to find them!)
    * ManyToOne relationships (associations)
    * Fixtures (Dummy data) using Faker

    ... and (like always) a lot more goodies are mixed in.
