title: Joyful Development with Symfony 3

summary: |
    Ready to get serious with Symfony? You've come to the right place!
    
    Get your first application off on the right foot by coding along with a real
    application, using the right tools and learning the best practices from the
    lead author of the Symfony documentation. These fundamentals will get you ready
    for *everything* else you'll need to do with Symfony in the future.

    In this screencast, we start building an application from the ground-up, exploring
    the most fundamental parts of the application:

    * Installation and Setup
    * Route Essentials
    * Mastering Controllers & Response
    * Services and the Container
    * Twig
    * JSON Responses
    * Configuration and Environments

    ... and other goodies mixed in.
