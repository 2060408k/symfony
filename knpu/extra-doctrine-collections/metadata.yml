title: 'Doctrine Collections: ManyToMany, Forms & other Complex Relations'

summary: |
    With the [basic of Doctrine relations](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/doctrine-relations)
    behind us, it's time to dive deeper and get our hands dirty with some real-world,
    but complex collections. Honestly, this is the *hardest* part of Doctrine: so
    let's get it *right*:

    * Creating ManyToMany associations
    * Querying on ManyToMany relations
    * Mapping the inverse (collection) side of a relation
    * Keeping the owning & inverse sides in-sync
    * Using orphan removal to delete items in a collection
    * Rendering relationship data from both sides
    * Filtering collections efficiently with Criteria
    * Cascading onto relatied Entities
    * Dealing with complex collection forms
    * Adding "extra" data to the "join table"

    Doctrine relationships take a little bit more work to get setup. So let's
    master this stuff, setup our relationships to win, and get back to work.
